# **What's this ?**

It's a User-Script for Pokemon Showdown, when you execute the script it will play for you.
However the main reason it was created was to play against it toget better at pokemon battles, however I still didn't get any opinion or approuval on it from the PS staff, so it's kind of in a stale situation...

# **How to use it ?**

Choose the version of the script you want then copy the content into your console when you're in Pokemon Showdown.

To run the script just type the following command and it should play when in a battle :

```
startGameLoop()
```
> In case it crash or stop working you'll have to reload the page and do the steps all over again.


If you don't want to do these steps again everytime you want to use it, there's also a TamperMonkey version wich add a button replacing the logo of PS, it's also the lastest version of the script right now.

> [!WARNING]
> **Just be aware that every version were only tested and made using a gen 9 format and on a PC.**
